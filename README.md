# Lagos House Price Prediction Project

## Project Brief
You just got hired as a data scientist within a real estate property aggregation company that runs an aggregation website. Your organisation has a web app that aggregates properties for rent/sale from various agents across the country. 

A week after your resumption, you get a mail from your boss with the following details:

> Hello,
> 
> Welcome onboard, we need you to help us create a solution that addresses the issues customers have been having. Our customers are complaining about the user experience of the site. They have indicated that they need a rent budget estimator feature that gives them a quick estimate of their rent budget based on parameters such as location, size etc. which will be provided by them. 
> 
> Based on the analysis recently done by the UI/UX team, the average customer typically needs to go through 10-20 web pages of properties to develop reasonable budget estimate. They believe this is not efficient and suggested we develop an algorithm that does this at the click of a button.

### Tools
- [Plotly Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/) for visualization and web apps.
- Python for machine learning.

### Tasks
#### Level: Beginner
#### Data Path: Data Science
- Using Python, you are expected to scrape the data from propertypro.ng.
- Develop a regression model that predicts house prices based on the data you scraped
- Using Plotly Dash, you are expected to create stunning interface which customers can interact with your model on.

### Deliverables
- ML model that predicts house prices
- Dash app that users can interact with to predict prices of house in the following areas Gbagada, Lekki Phase 1, Ajah, Ikorodu, Yaba, Surulere and Ikeja.

### Additional Tasks (compulsory for Data/ML engineers but optional for data scientists)
#### Level: Advanced
#### Data Path: Data Science | Data Engineer | Machine Learning Engineer
- Build an API that scrapes propertypro,.
- Turn house price prediction model into an API that can be used with the dash app.
- Using Computer Vision models:
    - Generate new features from the pictures of houses to be used in the house price prediction model.
    - Allow users to upload pictures of their house so you can estimate the number of bedrooms, etc and get a house price prediction.
- Test your APIs using Postman.
- Deploy the dash app on a cloud server of your choice using Docker.

### Additional Deliverables (compulsory for Data/ML engineers but optional for data scientists)
- API that scrapes the site data
- API for house price prediction deployed on cloud server using docker
- Computer Vision Model for price estimation.
